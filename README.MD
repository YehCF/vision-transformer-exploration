# The Investigation of Vision Transformers in Medical Image

This is the 2-week final project (for CIS520 Machine Learning), investigating the advantages and disadvantages of vision transformers in medical image. 


Specifically, we wanna get a sense of how vision transformers could be used in medical image application such as pneumonia classification or even detection.


More details are shown in the file: `The Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Transformers in Medical Images.pdf`


## Models
* Vision Transformers
  * `ViT`
  * `Swin Transformers`
* CNN
  * `Alex`
  * `VGG`
  * `Inception`
  * `ResNet`
  * `DenseNet`


## Experiments
1. Baseline with image size (224 x 224)
2. Performance comparision with adding difficult classes
3. Performance comparision with larger image size (512 x 512)




## Dataset
* [RSNA Pneumonia Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge)
